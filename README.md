Steps for working:
1) We create a layout.jsx file and start working on that instead of app.jsx
2) For the header and footer to remain same, we used the RouterProvider from the react-router-dom and a function know as Outlet
3) We create routes using createBrowserRouter and provided the path, elements and children
